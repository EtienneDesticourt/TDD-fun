/Design doc conventions
/All objects used by another object must be defined beforehand unless they're primitives or there is a circular relationship
/Objects are demarked in uppercase in their definition and in lowercase (except for first letter) in all other instances
/Primitives are fully lowercase and need not be defined
/Keywords:
/Is is used for hierarchy
/Has is ownership
/Can is functionnality and is followed by verb and complement
/Can Use allows the object to use the functionnalities of another object with a wrapper
/As can be used to describe the role of an owned object
